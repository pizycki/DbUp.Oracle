# DbUp.Oracle
_DbUp migrator adapter for Oracle_

## Tested on
 * [DbUp](https://github.com/DbUp/DbUp) @ [3.3.5](https://www.nuget.org/packages/dbup/3.3.5)
 * Oracle 12c
 * Windows 8.1
 * .NET 4.6 (but compiled on 3.5 to keep original library framework version)
 * [Visual Studio 2015/17](https://www.visualstudio.com) and [R# 2016/17](https://www.jetbrains.com/resharper/)
 
## Thanks to
This project strongly bases on two other DbUp Oracle implementations proposed by [@billydavis](https://github.com/billydavis) ([here](https://github.com/billydavis/DbUp)) and [@SimonRupar](https://github.com/SimonRupar) ([here](https://github.com/SimonRupar/DbUp)).
Also thanks to my colleague Mariusz Janicki for help in making this adapter.

## Will adapter for DbUp 4.0 come up?
No plans for it (yet).
